**ADR Structure**

All ADR (Architecture Decision Record) and technical report files in this folder must follow this minimal structure:

```
# Title (short, descriptive)

## Status
Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded

## Context
What is the background or problem being addressed?

## Decision
What decision was made and why?

## Consequences
What are the results or implications of this decision?
```

Additional sections (Motivation, Alternatives, References, etc.) are optional but encouraged for complex decisions.
