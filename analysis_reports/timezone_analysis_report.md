# Analysis Report on Timezone Names with Automatic DST Calculation Feasibility

## Current State Assessment
- **Timezone Names**: The current implementation uses standard timezone names but lacks automatic Daylight Saving Time (DST) adjustments.
- **DST Handling**: Currently, the system requires manual adjustments for DST, leading to potential errors and inconsistencies.

## Technical Considerations
- **Data Source**: Evaluate the reliability of the data source for timezone information. Consider using libraries like `tzdata` or services like `timeanddate.com`.
- **Time Complexity**: Automatic DST calculations may add overhead, especially when handling multiple timezones simultaneously.
- **Libraries**: Investigate existing libraries that provide built-in DST handling, such as `pytz` or `zoneinfo` in Python.

## Memory Constraints
- **Memory Usage**: Assess the memory footprint of storing timezone data, especially when considering multiple timezones and DST rules.
- **Optimization**: Consider lazy loading of timezone data to reduce initial memory consumption.

## Implementation Options Comparison
| Option                       | Pros                                         | Cons                                         |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Manual DST Adjustments      | Simple to implement                          | Error-prone, labor-intensive                 |
| Use of Libraries            | Reliable, well-maintained                    | Dependency management, potential bloat      |
| Custom Implementation        | Tailored to specific needs                   | High development time, requires thorough testing |

## Investigation Recommendations
- **Research Existing Libraries**: Review the latest libraries for timezone handling and their performance.
- **Prototype Automatic DST**: Create a small prototype to evaluate the feasibility and performance impact of automatic DST calculations.

## Risk Assessment
- **Implementation Risks**: Identify potential risks in transitioning to an automatic DST calculation system, including bugs in current logic and performance degradation.
- **User Impact**: Analyze how changes might affect users, especially those relying on accurate time data.

## Next Steps
1. Review and finalize the analysis report.
2. Conduct a team meeting to discuss findings and gather input.
3. Develop a prototype based on selected implementation option.
4. Plan for a phased rollout of the new system with adequate testing.
