## Supported Devices

- **Inkplate 5 V2**
- **Inkplate 2**
- **Inkplate 6 Flick**
- **Inkplate 10** *(not tested on hardware)*

> **Note:** Inkplate 10 is not tested on real hardware, as I do not own all Inkplate boards. If you have an untested or unsupported device and want to help test or ensure support: please [create an issue](https://github.com/jantielens/inkplate-dashboard/issues) or open a discussion!

## Getting started
1. Connect your Inkplate device to your computer via USB.
2. Flash the firmware using one of these methods:
	
	**Option A: Web-based flasher (recommended)**
	- Visit [https://jantielens.github.io/inkplate-dashboard/](https://jantielens.github.io/inkplate-dashboard/)
	- Select your Inkplate model and click "Connect" to flash directly from your browser
	- No downloads or additional software required!
	
	**Option B: Manual flashing**
	- Download firmware from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jantielens/inkplate-dashboard/releases) and flash using [ESPHome Flasher](https://github.com/esphome/esphome-flasher) or similar tools
3. Power on your device. The onboarding flow has two steps:
	- **Step 1: WiFi Setup (AP Mode)** – On first boot, the device creates a WiFi access point. Connect to it and enter your WiFi credentials in the browser.
	- **Step 2: Dashboard Configuration (Config Mode)** – After joining your WiFi, the device automatically enters config mode. Access the device's IP in your browser to configure your image(s) with display intervals (1 image for single mode, 2+ for carousel).
	The device will guide you through each step directly on the screen.
5. Enjoy your personalized, always-on dashboard!
